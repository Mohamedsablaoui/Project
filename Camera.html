                    <h3>How It Works</h3>
                    <p>The TP-Link Tapo C200 works through a combination of its hardware features and smart technology to provide comprehensive indoor surveillance. Here’s a breakdown of how it functions:

Camera Hardware:

360° Pan and Tilt: The camera has the ability to rotate horizontally and vertically, which allows it to cover a wide area and track movement. This is achieved through its motorized base that you can control remotely.
1080p Resolution: It captures high-definition video, providing clear and detailed footage.
Night Vision: Infrared LEDs enable the camera to capture video even in low light or complete darkness.
Connectivity:

WiFi: The camera connects to your home WiFi network, allowing it to stream video and send data to your smartphone or other devices.
Smart Features:

Real-time Notifications: The camera can send alerts to your phone when it detects motion or specific activities, such as someone entering the room. This is useful for immediate awareness of any unusual events.
Motion Detection and Tracking: The camera can automatically follow moving objects or people within its field of view. It uses built-in sensors and algorithms to track movement and adjust its position as needed.
Remote Control: You can control the camera’s movements, view live footage, and access settings through the Tapo app on your smartphone. This means you can adjust the camera’s position or view specific areas of your home from anywhere.
Voice Control Integration:

Alexa Compatibility: By integrating with Amazon Alexa, you can use voice commands to control the camera, such as viewing live feeds on an Echo Show or adjusting settings through voice interaction.
Overall, the Tapo C200 combines these technologies to provide a user-friendly, effective indoor surveillance solution that enhances home security and convenience.</p>
